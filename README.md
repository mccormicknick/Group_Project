**Installation:**
To use this project, first clone the repo onto your device using the command below:

git init

git clone https://github.com/mccormicknick/Group_Project.git


**Project Objective:**

The interest in computer vision specifically, fruit and vegetable recognition, is increasing exponentially because it is considered an effective way of reducing the human workload. It can also be helpful for disease detection, fruit harvesting, optimizing point of sale (POS) systems, and educating children/people with learning disabilities. A lot of research has been conducted on fruit recognition but there are still many challenges in current methodologies that needed to be addressed to design an efficient fruit recognition system. Thus, this research focuses on developing a fruit recognition system using a machine learning algorithm. This study performs the classification of cherry, strawberry, and tomato using convolutional neural networks.



**Dataset properties:**

The dataset Fruits360 contains 55244 RGB images consisting of 100x100 pixels each.
The dataset will be divided into three classes: tomato, cherry, and strawberry.
4500 images will be evenly divided amongst the three classes; 1500 each.
All 4500 images will be converted to 300x300 


**Repository Structure:**

Our original Fruits360 repository has been copied into the fruits-360 folder.
Our traindata folder holds our 4500 images split into their respective folder; cherry, tomato, and strawberry.
test.py & train.py show the code used to seperate our 4500 images from the original 55244.
Code.py is our full code containing our Convolutional Neural Network.
Report.docx is our final report summarizing the project.
Final Project-Team 6.mp4 is our video presentation of the project.
