# Fruits Recognition Using Deep Learning Techniques
Nicholas McCormick + Pedram Khannakhjavani

**Dataset properties**

The dataset Fruits360 contains 55244 RGB images consisting of 100x100 pixels each.
The dataset will be divided into three classes: tomato, cherry, and strawberry.
4500 images will be evenly divided amongst the three classes; 1500 each.
All 4500 images will be converted to 300x300 


**Repository Structure**

Our original Fruits360 repository has been copied into the fruits-360 folder.
Our traindata folder holds our 4500 images split into their respective folder; cherry, tomato, and strawberry.
test.py & train.py show the code used to seperate our 4500 images from the original 55244.
Code.py is our full code containing our Convolutional Neural Network.
Report.docx is our final report summarizing the project.
